### SQL: A Relational Database Language

  When specifying a **relational algebra** query, it becomes the responsability of the user to specify **how** \-in what order\- to execute the query operations.

DBMSs provide (through **SQL**) a high\-level **declarative** language interface, so the user only specifies **what** the result is, leaviing the actual optimization and decisions on how to execute the query to the DBMS.

Originally, SQL was called **SEQUEL**: for **S**tructured **E**nglish **QUE**ry **L**anguage.
